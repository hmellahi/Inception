Remember that the quality of the defenses, hence the quality of the of the school on the labor market depends on you. The remote defences during the Covid crisis allows more flexibility so you can progress into your curriculum, but also brings more risks of cheat, injustice, laziness, that will harm everyone's skills development. We do count on your maturity and wisdom during these remote defenses for the benefits of the entire community.
Scale for project minitalk
You should evaluate 1 student in this team
Git repository
git@vogsphere-v2-bg.1337.ma:vogsphere/intra-uuid-352d62e6-b0a0-4965-af66-3c96b2817d4d-3578493
Introduction
Please comply with the following rules:

- Remain polite, courteous, respectful, and constructive throughout the
evaluation process. The well-being of the community depends on it.

- Identify with the student or group whose work is evaluated the possible
dysfunctions in their project. Take the time to discuss and debate the
problems that may have been identified.

- You must consider that there might be some differences in how your peers
might have understood the project's instructions and the scope of its
functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade them as honestly as
possible. The pedagogy is useful only and only if the peer-evaluation is
done seriously.
Guidelines
- Only grade the work that was turned in the Git repository of the evaluated
student or group.

- Double-check that the Git repository belongs to the student(s). Ensure that
the project is the one expected. Also, check that "git clone" is used in an
empty folder.

- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you and make you
evaluate something that is not the content of the official repository.

- To avoid any surprises and if applicable, review together any scripts used
to facilitate the grading (scripts for testing or automation).

- If you have not completed the assignment you are going to evaluate, you have
to read the entire subject before starting the evaluation process.

- Use the available flags to report an empty repository, a non-functioning
program, a Norm error, cheating, and so forth.
In these cases, the evaluation process ends and the final grade is 0,
or -42 in case of cheating. However, except for cheating, student are
strongly encouraged to review together the work that was turned in,
to identify any mistakes that shouldn't be repeated in the future.

Preliminaries
If cheating is suspected, the evaluation stops here. Use the "Cheat" flag to report it. Take this decision calmly, wisely, and please, use this button with caution.

Preliminary tests
- Defense can only happen if the evaluated student or group is present.
This way everybody learns by sharing knowledge.
- If no work has been submitted (or wrong files, wrong directory, or
wrong filenames), the grade is 0, and the evaluation process ends.
- No Empty git (= nothing in git repository).
- No Norm error.
- Cheating (= -42).
- No compilation error or re-link.

If all of these points are valid, check yes and continues the correction.
If not use the appropriate flag at the end of the scale!
 Yes  No

Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)

Mandatory part
This project is an introduction to signals Check the code and usage of signals only to communicate.

corrects !
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)

- No more of 8 signals to pass 1 character -> 2 points

Received messages must be displayed by the server, and must be obviously

Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
